## Tools Used

* **SQL**: For querying and retrieving data.
* **Power BI Desktop**: For data modeling, visualization, and dashboard creation.
* **Excel**: Potentially used for initial data exploration or as a data source.
* **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)**: For creating calculated columns and measures.
* **DAX Studio**: Used for optimizing the performance of the Power BI report.

## Power BI Techniques Learnt

This project provided hands-on experience with various Power BI techniques, including:


* **Creating calculated columns** to derive new information from existing data.
* **Developing measures using DAX language** for complex calculations and aggregations.
* **Data modeling**: Establishing relationships between different data tables.
* **Using Bookmarks**: Implementing navigation and switching between different visual states.
* **Page navigation with buttons**: Creating a user-friendly interface for exploring different dashboard sections.
* **Creating a date table using M language**: For robust time-based analysis.
* **Implementing dynamic titles**: Making titles responsive to applied filters.
* **Using KPI indicators**: Visually representing performance against targets.
* **Conditional formatting**: Applying visual cues (icons, background colors) based on data values.
* **Data validation techniques**: Ensuring data accuracy and integrity within the report.
* **Power BI Services**: Publishing and sharing the report online.
* **Power BI App creation**: Bundling and sharing the dashboard as an application.
* **Collaboration, workspace, and access permissions** within Power BI Services.

## Companyâ€™s Background: AtliQ Hardware

AtliQ Hardware is a rapidly expanding global company specializing in computer and computer accessories. Their products are distributed through three main channels: Retailers, Direct sales, and Distributors. Recognizing a recent setback with an unsuccessful expansion in America based on limited analysis, and noting the data-driven approach of their competitors, AtliQ Hardware is now prioritizing the development of their own analytics capabilities to inform future strategic decisions and ensure continued success in the industry.


## Importing Data into Power BI

The data for this project was sourced from a **MySQL database**. Connecting Power BI to the database involved providing the necessary access credentials to import the relevant datasets.

## Dashboard Designing

The dashboard design followed mockups provided as requirements. The development process involved iteratively creating visuals and developing necessary measures using DAX as needed. The dashboard is structured with a central navigation hub and dedicated views for different business functions.

### Home View

The Home view serves as the central navigation point, providing buttons to access the following specific views:

* **Finance View**: Focuses on financial performance analysis.
* **Sales View**: Analyzes sales trends, product performance, and regional data.
* **Marketing View**: Provides insights into marketing campaign effectiveness and customer acquisition.
* **Supply Chain View**: Tracks inventory, logistics, and fulfillment KPIs.
